# LMS-OSRS-Lobby-Concept
Little idea I had about a lobby system from runescape which hops the player aswell


We generate a bunch of players and drop them to the same world if some requirements are met. it has it's limitations like it doesn't account for ELO.   
   
To see the players being hopped, unncoment line 117 in Lobby.Java 
//System.out.println("Player hopped: "+group[i][0]+"/"+group[i][3]+"/"+world);
